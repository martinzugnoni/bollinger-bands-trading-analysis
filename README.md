The data set was downloaded from http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/, corresponding to the historical BTCUSD price in Bitstamp exchange. Despite having data from 2014, the analysis is mainly concentrated in prices during 2018.

I used Pandas to parse and analyze prices, and Matplotlib to plot strategies returns.
